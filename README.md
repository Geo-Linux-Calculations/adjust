# ADJUST

### DESCRIPTION

NGS "Bluebooking" process for GPS projects.

The Adjust & Utilities program suite for GPS projects has been released to production. An update was required to provide new transformation parameters due to the release of a newer IGb14 GNSS geodetic reference frame by the International GNSS Service (IGS).
